# Data-Analysis-Using-SQL

This project is centered around data analysis and performing Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations using SQL queries. It is a query-intensive project designed to sharpen My query-writing skills while working with large datasets. Additionally, as a supplementary component, I will  creating data visualizations using Tableau. The primary data source for this project will be the publicly available data from BigQuery, and I will connect to BigQuery using DBeaver as My preferred database client.

Project Objectives:

Data Analysis :chart_with_upwards_trend: : We will explore and analyze large datasets available in the BigQuery public data repository. The analysis will involve understanding the dataset's structure.

Query Development :thumbsup: : The core of this project involves creating complex SQL queries to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data. We will be working with a diverse range of SQL operations, including filtering, aggregating, joining to derive specific information from the dataset.

Data Manipulation (DML) :blue_book: : We will learn and apply Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations to modify and update data within the database. 

Database Connection :basecamp: : We will set up and manage a connection to BigQuery using DBeaver, a popular open-source database tool. This will serve as our gateway to interact with BigQuery datasets.

Data Visualization :bar_chart: : In addition to the query-intensive work, we will use Tableau, a leading data visualization tool, to create compelling and informative visual representations of the data. These visualizations will help communicate the insights and findings from our data analysis effectively.
